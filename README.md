# VANGUARD-CX-DA-AMAZON
IronHack Customer Experience Data Analyst project - Amazon group


## Project Introduction:

In this project, we act as a data analytics team working for Vanguard, tasked with analyzing customer experience data from a digital experiment conducted on a new application.

The experiment focuses on changes to the user interface (UI), including clearer instructions and improved prompts, with the aim of making the process smoother and more intuitive. The goal is to determine whether these changes lead to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from 15 March to 20 June, using an A/B testing approach:
- Control group: Clients using the older version of the application  
- Test group: Clients using the newer version of the application  

Based on the results of our analysis, we provide insights and recommendations on whether the new design should be fully launched by the company.
